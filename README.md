# DeWashPayPas for Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi application is for integration between the self-service car wash controller and contactless payment device Ingenico.

The application communicates with the car wash controller through the Modbus protocol. Analyze commands and send them to the contactless payment device. Then receive responses from the payment device, generate a package and send it to the hardware device.
